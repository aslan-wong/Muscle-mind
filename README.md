Project Portfolio: Monitoring Neuromuscular Activity during Exercise
Project Overview:

This project introduces a novel method for monitoring neuromuscular activity during exercise through an advanced EMG fitness shirt integrated with a multitask and multiclassification network. The primary aim is to assess attentional focus during strength training exercises, which plays a crucial role in enhancing muscle contraction and workout effectiveness. The innovation combines wearable biosensor technology with machine learning to provide real-time feedback on exercise efficiency at the neuromuscular level.
Key Contributions:

Wearable Technology Integration:
        Developed a low-cost, non-invasive, and highly conductive EMG fitness shirt with eight EMG sensing electrodes placed on key upper limb muscles (pectoralis, deltoids, triceps, and biceps).
        The shirt monitors muscle activation signals during free-weight strength training exercises in real-time.

Multitasking and Multiclassification Network:
        Created a robust network that classifies exercise types, attentional focus conditions, and different resistance levels (67% and 85% of one-repetition maximum, or 1RM).
        The system achieved a 94.79% average precision in detecting attentional focus across varying weights, demonstrating its ability to track muscle contraction with high accuracy.

Experimental Setup:
        Conducted a study involving 12 healthy participants performing five standard strength exercises (bench press, pullovers, front raises, kickbacks, and bicep curls) under both attentional focus and non-focus conditions.
        The experimental design featured various repetitions and rest periods to assess the impact of attentional focus on neuromuscular activity.

Results and Impact:
        The system demonstrated that attentional focus during strength training significantly enhances muscle contraction, even at lower resistance levels.
        The findings suggest that adopting attentional focus with lightweight lifting can activate more muscle fibers, supporting hypertrophy and strength development.
        This approach provides valuable insights for fitness professionals and practitioners aiming to optimize workout routines for muscle activation efficiency.

Future Directions:
        Expansion of the system to cover more complex exercises and additional muscle groups.
        Development of a mobile application to make the system accessible to everyday users for real-time feedback on their training performance.

Technologies Used:

Electromyography (EMG): A biosignal technology that captures electrical activity in muscles, indicating muscle activation and contraction.
    Machine Learning: A multitask neural network was utilized to classify attentional focus, exercise type, and muscle contraction levels.
    Wearable Sensors: Custom-designed EMG fitness shirt fitted with dry electrodes and a wireless signal transmission system.

The findings of this project have been published in the journal Biosensors under the title Monitoring Neuromuscular Activity during Exercise: A New Approach to Assessing Attentional Focus Using an EMG Fitness Shirt (Biosensors 2023, 13, 61).
