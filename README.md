Neuromuscular Activity Monitoring for Strength Training. Developed an EMG shirt with noninvasive electrodes and a multitasking classification network to monitor neuromuscular activity during strength training. This system detects attentional focus by measuring muscle activity, achieving an average precision of 94.79% across various force conditions. It effectively tracks exercise effectiveness at the neuromuscular level, proving that attentional focus can enhance upper-limb muscle activation even during low-intensity exercises. The device is designed to be cost-effective and user-friendly, enhancing the overall user experience.
